# Section 12 : Mini Project on OOP Concept in Python

## DataBase : The DataBase that have been used in this Project has been Gathered based on the Movies, Series, Doumnetaries and Clips Which has been Randomly Selected and each of them has the Following Parameters.

### Movie : Title, Production Year, Duration, URL, Imdb Score, Director, Casts and Genre.

### Series : Title, Production Year, Duration, URL, Imdb Score, number of seasons, number of the episodes, Director, Casts and Genre.

### Documentaries : Title, Production Year, Duration, URL, Imdb Score, Director, Casts and Subject.

### Clips: Title, Production Year, Duration, URL, Views and Uploader.

among the parameters defined in each dataframe, four parameters including Title, Production Year, Duration and URL have been the same among all DataBases and thus they have been viewd as inherited parameters from the Media Class and the rest of the parameters in each DataBase are Specific to their DataBase.
